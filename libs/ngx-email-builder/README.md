# ngx-email-builder

This library provides a set of abstract classes to build email template builders using Angular. It is part of the [NGX Email Builder](https://ngb.email) project.

As an example, see the [Tailwind Email Builder](https://ngb.email/tailwind/) library that uses `ngx-email-builder` and TailwindCSS to build the email template.

Besides, you can create your own email builder with different themes like [Bootstrap](https://ngb.email/bootstrap/), [Material](https://ngb.email/material/), etc.

Here's a list of available themes:
- [Bootstrap Email Builder](https://ngb.email/bootstrap/) - Bootstrap theme.
- [Material Email Builder](https://ngb.email/material/) - Material theme.
- [Tailwind Email Builder](https://ngb.email/tailwind/) - TailwindCSS theme.
- [Bulma Email Builder](https://ngb.email/bulma/) - Bulma theme.
- [PrimeNG Email Builder](https://ngb.email/primeng/) - PrimeNG theme.
