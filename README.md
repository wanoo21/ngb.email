# Introduction to NGX Email Builder

Welcome to the documentation of the **Next-Generation eXtensible Email Builder** or shorter **NGX Email Builder**.

**NGX Email Builder** is an Angular library that contains bunch of abstract classes, [services](/services), [directives](/directives), [pipes](/pipes) and other Angular tools that you can use to create your own email builder.

You need to have a basic understanding of Angular to use this library. If you don't know Angular, you can learn it [here](https://angular.io/guide/quickstart).
This library contains a lot of features, so it might be a bit overwhelming at first. But don't worry, this documentation will help you to get started.

## Some of the features of this library are:

* Drag and drop builder (blocks, columns).
* Responsive emails (mobile friendly) based on the [MJML](https://mjml.io/) framework.
* Customize the builder to look like your brand - [custom templates](/templates)
* Middleware to allow or disallow certain actions (e.g. disallow adding a new block) - [middleware](/services/aipemailbuildermiddlewareservice.md)
* Custom blocks (e.g. a block that allows you to add a product to the email) - [custom blocks](/blocks/custom-block.md)
* Change the content of the email with a simple API (useful for dynamic emails) - [dynamic emails](/usage-examples/generating-an-email-using-the-library.md)
* Export the email as HTML or MJML (useful for debugging) - [exporting emails](/usage-examples/exporting-an-email.md)
* And many more...

This is just a short introduction to the library, check the [ngb.email](https://ngb.email) website for more information.

Without further ado, let's get started!
