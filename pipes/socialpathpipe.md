# SocialPathPipe

The `SocialPathPipe` is an Angular pipe that returns a full network path based on the network name and configuration. This pipe is useful when building social icons in an email template.

Here are some key points to know about the `SocialPathPipe`:

* The pipe is included in the `IPEmailBuilderModule`.
* The `SocialPathPipe` takes one required parameter: `network`, which is a string that represents the name of the social network.
* The `transform` method of the `SocialPathPipe` returns a string that represents the full network path based on the configuration.
* The configuration used in the `SocialPathPipe` is taken from the `IP_EMAIL_BUILDER_CONFIG` injection token, which is provided by the `IPEmailBuilderModule`.
* The path generated by the `SocialPathPipe` is based on the configuration `socialIconsPath` property and the `network` parameter.
* The `SocialPathPipe` should be used inside an `img` element's `src` attribute.

Here's an example of how to use the `SocialPathPipe` in an Angular component:

```html
<!-- example.component.html -->
<img [src]="network | socialPath" alt="Social Network Icon">
```
