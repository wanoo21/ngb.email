# ToBodyBlockPipe

## Methods

#### transform()

The `transform()` method returns the corresponding `AIPEmailBuilderBlockExtendedOptions` object based on the provided `IIPEmailBuilderBlockData`.

**Parameters:**

* `data`: The `IIPEmailBuilderBlockData` object to transform.

**Returns:**

* The corresponding `AIPEmailBuilderBlockExtendedOptions` object.

**Exceptions:**

* TypeError if the block type is not found.

## Usage

```html
<ng-container *ngFor="let block of blocksData">
  <aip-block [block]="block" cdkDrag [cdkDragData]="block | toBodyBlock"></aip-block>
</ng-container>
```

By iterating through `blocksData` using `*ngFor` and creates `<aip-block>` components.

Acting as a non-intrusive container,`<ng-container>` keeps the DOM unaffected.

Passing block as an input,`<aip-block>` enables drag and drop through `cdkDrag` and assigns transformed block as drag data using `[cdkDragData]`.

Multiple `<aip-block>` instances are generated by the code, each representing a block from `blocksData`.

The `cdkDrag` enables drag and drop, and `toBodyBlock` transforms `block` for drag data.
